        | The latest version of the system incorporates an expanded historic dataset sourced from the  
        a(href="https://www.dws.gov.za/hydrology/") South Africa Government Website
        |  providing functionality to more easily view and access hydrology related data and information. The currently stored historic data is non-comprehensive, but provides a prototype template in which current data could be migrated and added with the relevant functions.
      h1.text-start.mb-4 About
      p.text-start DataFlow is an operational system for data visualisation and information distribution. It has been developed by Synoptic Group 62 in collaboration with University of East Anglia as an end-of-year project. The system is operational but must be updated manually. The concept is to be able to have real-time or near real-time updates with access to the weather station and/or a relevant API. 
      h1.text-start.mb-4 Database 
      p.text-start The database is split into different schemas depending on the types of data available. Each database has a table for each specific weather station in the region, which can have data uploaded to it by a relevant admin. This data is then collated and viewable and interactable on our website, DataFlow.

          p My main role for the project was the information / education page. I worked on the database, parsing and design. I learned a lot about front end on this project as I wasn't very experienced with it. When I am not working on DataFlow, I like to play the small indie game League of Legends.

          p I worked on many different parts of the project. The main things were the planning and design stage, involving the LoFi models and the idea of the solution. I worked on a few of the pages, including this one, as well as some universal features such as the navbar and footer.
