        .subheading How Everyday Waste Contributes to Flood Risks and What You Can Do
        img.main-img(src="/images/floodbrev.png", alt="An image showing the impact of waste on flooding")
        p Improper waste disposal poses a great threat to urban environments, contributing to increased flood risks. In many urban areas, including Makers Valley in Johannesburg, limited landfill space is a pressing issue, with existing landfills rapidly reaching capacity. This is made worse by problems such as illegal waste dumping, even in areas that receive waste management services.
        p When waste is not properly disposed of, it can obstruct drainage systems, worsening flooding during heavy rains. The presence of bagged rubbish left on streets, which usually gets torn open and scattered, further contributes to this problem. Waste management services, such as Pikitup in Johannesburg, collect thousands of tonnes of waste daily, yet the sheer volume and improper disposal methods remain a challenge. The issue is also linked to aging infrastructure and a growing population, which strain existing waste and water systems.

        p To combat these issues, initiatives like "Separation at Source" are crucial. This scheme encourages residents to separate their waste for recycling, aiming to reduce landfill waste by at least 33%. Proper waste separation not only extends the life of landfills but also reduces the hazardous conditions faced by informal recyclers who sift through waste for valuable materials like plastic, paper, cans, and glass.

        p By understanding the impact of our waste habits and actively participating in proper disposal and recycling efforts, we can contribute to more resilient communities and mitigate the devastating effects of flooding.
        p To prevent wastage from contributing to flooding in your community:
        p
          strong Separate your waste:&nbsp;
          | Participate in local recycling programs by separating recyclables (plastic, paper, cans, glass) from general waste.
        p
          strong Use designated bins:&nbsp;
          | Always place your waste in appropriate bins or bags for collection.
        p
          strong Avoid illegal dumping:&nbsp;
          | Never dispose of waste in undesignated areas, as this directly contributes to blockages and environmental hazards.
        p
          strong Support waste management initiatives:&nbsp;
          | Be aware of and support local efforts to improve waste collection and recycling, such as those implemented by services like Pikitup.
